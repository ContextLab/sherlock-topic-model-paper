\section*{Introduction}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend What does it mean to \textit{remember} something? In traditional episodic memory experiments \citep[e.g., list-learning or trial-based experiments;][]{Murd62a, Kaha96}, remembering is often cast as a discrete\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend binary operation: each studied item may be separated from the rest of one's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{experiences, and that item may be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experience and }\DIFaddend labeled as having been \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recalled versus }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{either recalled or }\DIFaddend forgotten. More nuanced studies might incorporate self-reported confidence measures as a proxy for memory strength, or ask participants to discriminate between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``recollecting '' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recollecting }\DIFaddend the (contextual) details of an experience \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend having a general feeling of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``familiarity'' \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Yone02}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{familiarity~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Yone02}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Using well-controlled, trial-based experimental designs, the field has amassed a wealth of information regarding human episodic memory~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[for review see][]{Kaha12}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  }\DIFaddend However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{characterizing and evaluating memoryin more realistic contexts (e.  g., recounting a recent experience to a friend) is fundamentally different in at least three ways~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[for review also see][]{KoriGold94, HukEtal18}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{there are fundamental properties of the external world and our memories that trial-based experiments are not well suited to capture~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[for review, also see][]{KoriGold94, HukEtal18}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  First, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{real world recall is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{our experiences and memories are }\DIFaddend continuous, rather than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{discrete.  Unlike in trial-based experiments, removing a (naturalistic ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discrete---isolating a naturalistic }\DIFaddend event from the context in which it occurs can substantially change its meaning.  Second, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the specific words used to describe an experience have little bearing on whether the experience should be considered to have been ``remembered.''  Asking whether the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{whether or not the }\DIFaddend rememberer has precisely reproduced a specific set of words \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to describe }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in describing }\DIFaddend a given experience is nearly orthogonal to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{whether }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{how well }\DIFaddend they were actually able to remember it.  In classic (e.g., list-learning) memory studies, by contrast, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{counting }\DIFdelend the number or proportion of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{precise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{exact}} \DIFaddend recalls is often \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered to be }\DIFaddend a primary metric \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend assessing the quality of participants' memories.  Third, one might remember the \DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{gist}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{or essence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{essence (or a general summary) }\DIFaddend of an experience but forget (or neglect to recount) particular \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{low-level }\DIFaddend details.  Capturing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{essence }\DIFaddend of what happened is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{typically the main ``point'' of recounting a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{often a main goal of recounting an episodic }\DIFaddend memory to a listener\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{whereas, depending on the circumstances, accurate recall of any specific detail may be irrelevant.  There is no analog of the gist of an experience in most traditional memory experiments; rather we tend to assess participants' abilities to recover specific details (e.
g., computing the proportion of specific stimuli they remember, which presentation positions the remembered stimuli came from, etc.).
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, whereas the inclusion of specific low-level details is often less pertinent.
}\DIFaddend 

How might \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one go about formally characterizing the gist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we formally characterize the }\textit{\DIFadd{essence}} \DIFaddend of an experience, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or whether that gist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and whether it }\DIFaddend has been recovered by the rememberer?  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Any }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{And how might we distinguish an experience's overarching essence from its low-level details?  One approach is to start by considering some fundamental properties of the dynamics of our experiences.  Each }\DIFaddend given moment of an experience \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{derives }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tends to derive }\DIFaddend meaning from surrounding moments, as well as from longer-range temporal associations~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g., ][]{LernEtal11}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  Therefore}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{LernEtal11, Mann19, Mann20}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  Therefore, }\DIFaddend the timecourse describing how an event unfolds is fundamental to its overall meaning.  Further, this hierarchy formed by our subjective experiences at different timescales defines a \textit{context} for each new moment~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g., ][]{HowaKaha02, HowaEtal14}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.,][]{HowaKaha02a, HowaEtal14}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , and plays an important role in how we interpret that moment and remember it later~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[for review see][]{MannEtal15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[for review see][]{MannEtal15, Mann20}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  Our memory systems can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then }\DIFdelend leverage these associations to form predictions that help guide our behaviors~\citep{RangRitc12}.  For example, as we navigate the world, the features of our subjective experiences tend to change gradually (e.g., the room or situation we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{find ourselves in at any given moment }\DIFaddend is strongly temporally autocorrelated), allowing us to form stable estimates of our current situation and behave accordingly~\citep{ZackEtal07, ZwaaRadv98}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although our experiences most often change gradually, they also occasionally change suddenly~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g., when we walk through a doorway; ][]{RadvZack17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Occasionally, this gradual drift of our ongoing experience is punctuated by sudden changes, or shifts~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g., when we walk through a doorway;][]{RadvZack17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  Prior research suggests that these sharp transitions (termed \textit{event boundaries}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{during an experience }\DIFdelend help to discretize our experiences \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(and their mental representations) }\DIFaddend into \textit{events}~\citep{RadvZack17, BrunEtal18, HeusEtal18b, ClewDava17, EzzyDava11, DuBrDava13}.  The interplay between the stable (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{within event}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within-event}\DIFaddend ) and transient (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{across event}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across-event}\DIFaddend ) temporal dynamics of an experience also provides a potential framework for transforming experiences into memories that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distill }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distills }\DIFaddend those experiences down to their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{essence-- i.  e., their gists.  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{essences.  }\DIFaddend For example, prior work has shown that event boundaries can influence how we learn sequences of items~\citep{HeusEtal18b, DuBrDava13}, navigate~\citep{BrunEtal18}, and remember and understand narratives~\citep{ZwaaRadv98, EzzyDava11}.  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This work also suggests a means of distinguishing the essence of an experience from its low-level details:  The overall structure of events and event transitions reflects how the high-level experience unfolds (i.e., its essence), while subtler event-level properties reflect its low-level details.  Prior research has also implicated a network of brain regions (including the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex) in playing a critical role in transforming experiences into structured and consolidated memories ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{TompDava17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend 

Here\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we sought to examine how the temporal dynamics of a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``naturalistic '' experience were }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{naturalistic experience were later }\DIFaddend reflected in participants' \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{later memoriesof that experience}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{memories.  We also sought to leverage the above conceptual insights into the distinctions between an experience's essence and its low-level details to build models that explicitly quantified these distinctions}\DIFaddend .  We analyzed an open dataset that comprised behavioral and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data collected as participants viewed and then verbally \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recalled }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recounted }\DIFaddend an episode of the BBC television \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{series }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{show }\DIFaddend \textit{Sherlock}~\citep{ChenEtal17}.  We developed a computational framework for characterizing the temporal dynamics of the moment-by-moment content of the episode and of participants' verbal recalls.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Specifically, we use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our framework uses }\DIFaddend topic modeling~\citep{BleiEtal03} to characterize the thematic conceptual (semantic) content present in each moment of the episode and recalls \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and we use Hidden Markov Models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by projecting each moment into a word embedding space.  We then use hidden Markov models}\DIFaddend ~\citep{Rabi89, BaldEtal17} to discretize \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this }\DIFaddend evolving semantic content into events.  In this way, we cast \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{naturalistic experiences (and recalls }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{both naturalistic experiences and memories }\DIFaddend of those experiences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as geometric }\DIFaddend \textit{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{topic }\DIFdelend trajectories} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{through word embedding space }\DIFaddend that describe how \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the experiences }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they }\DIFaddend evolve over time. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In other words, the episode's topic trajectory is a formalization of its gist.  }\DIFdelend Under this framework, successful remembering entails verbally \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``traversing '' the topic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{traversing the content }\DIFaddend trajectory of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{original }\DIFdelend episode, thereby reproducing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{original }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shape (essence) of the original experience.  Our framework captures the }\DIFaddend episode's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gist.  In addition, comparing the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{essence in the sequence of geometric coordinates for its events, and its low-level details by examining its within-event geometric properties.
}

\DIFadd{Comparing the overall }\DIFaddend shapes of the topic trajectories \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the original episode and of participants' retellings of the episode }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the episode and participants' recalls }\DIFaddend reveals which aspects of the episode\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s essence }\DIFaddend were preserved (or lost) in the translation into memory.  We also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{identified a network of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{develop two metrics for assessing participants' memories for low-level details: (1) the }\textit{\DIFadd{precision}} \DIFadd{with which a participant recounts details about each event, and (2) the }\textit{\DIFadd{distinctiveness}} \DIFadd{of their recall for each event, relative to other events.  We examine how these metrics relate to overall memory performance as judged by third-party human annotators.  We also compare and contrast our general approach to studying memory for naturalistic experiences with standard metrics for assessing performance on more traditional memory tasks, such as list-learning.  Last, we leverage our framework to identify networks of }\DIFaddend brain structures whose responses (as participants watched the episode) reflected the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{temporal dynamics }\DIFaddend of the episode \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, anda second network whose responses reflected }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and/or }\DIFaddend how participants would later recount \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the episode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it}\DIFaddend .


\section*{Results}
To characterize the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gists }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dynamic content }\DIFaddend of the \textit{Sherlock} episode \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{participants watched and their subsequent recountingsof the episode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and participants' subsequent recountings}\DIFaddend , we used a topic model~\citep{BleiEtal03} to discover the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{latent thematic content in the video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode's latent themes}\DIFaddend .  Topic models take as inputs a vocabulary of words to consider and a collection of text documents\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; they return as output two }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and return two output }\DIFaddend matrices.  The first \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{output }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of these }\DIFaddend is a \textit{topics matrix} whose rows are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{topics (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{topics}} \DIFadd{(or }\DIFaddend latent themes) and whose columns correspond to words in the vocabulary. The entries \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend the topics matrix \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{define }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reflect }\DIFaddend how each word in the vocabulary is weighted by each discovered topic.  For example, a detective-themed topic might weight heavily on words like ``crime,'' and ``search.''  The second output is a \textit{topic proportions matrix} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend with one row per document and one column per topic.  The topic proportions matrix describes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which mix topics is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the mixture of discovered topics }\DIFaddend reflected in each document.

\cite{ChenEtal17} collected hand-annotated information about each of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1000 (manually identified) scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1,000 (manually delineated) time segments }\DIFaddend spanning the roughly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{45 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{50 }\DIFaddend minute video used in their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{experiment.  This information }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{study.  Each annotation }\DIFaddend included: a brief narrative description of what was happening\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; whether the scene took placeindoors vs. outdoors; }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, the location where the action took place, the }\DIFaddend names of any characters on the screen\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; names of any characters who were in focus in the camera shot; names of characters who were speaking; the location where the scene took place; the camera angle (close up, medium, long, etc.); whether or not background music was present; }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and other similar details (for a full list of annotated features\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend see \textit{Methods}).  We took \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{from these annotations }\DIFdelend the union of all unique words (excluding stop words, such as ``and,'' ``or,'' ``but,'' etc.) across all features \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and scenes as the ``vocabulary '' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from all annotations as the vocabulary }\DIFaddend for the topic model.  We then concatenated the sets of words across all features contained in overlapping \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{50-scene sliding windows }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sliding windows of (up to) 50 annotations}\DIFaddend , and treated each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{50-scene sequence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{window }\DIFaddend as a single \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``document '' for the purposes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{document for the purpose }\DIFaddend of fitting the topic model.  Next, we fit a topic model with (up to) $K = 100$ topics to this collection of documents.  We found that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{27 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{32 }\DIFaddend unique topics (with non-zero weights) were sufficient to describe the time-varying content of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend (see \textit{Methods}; Figs.~\ref{fig:schematic}, \topics).  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Note }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We note }\DIFaddend that our approach is similar in some respects to Dynamic Topic Models~\citep{BleiLaff06} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend in that we sought to characterize how the thematic content of the episode evolved over time.  However, whereas Dynamic Topic Models are designed to characterize how the properties of \textit{collections} of documents change over time, our sliding window approach allows us to examine the topic dynamics within a single document (or video).  Specifically, our approach yielded (via the topic proportions matrix) a single \textit{topic vector} for each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{timepoint of the episode (we set timepoints }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sliding window of annotations transformed by the topic model.  We then stretched (interpolated) the resulting windows-by-topics matrix }\DIFaddend to match the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{acquisition times of the 1976 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{time series of the 1,976 }\DIFaddend fMRI volumes collected as participants viewed the episode\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend .

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{32 }\DIFaddend topics we found were heavily character-focused (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e.g.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{i.e.}\DIFaddend , the top-weighted word in each topic was nearly always a character) and could be roughly divided into themes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that were primarily Sherlock Holmes-focused (Sherlock is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{centered around Sherlock Holmes (}\DIFaddend the titular character)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; primarily John Watson-focused (John is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, John Watson (}\DIFaddend Sherlock's close confidant and assistant)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; or that involved Sherlockand John interacting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, supporting characters (e.g., Inspector Lestrade, Sergeant Donovan, or Sherlock's brother Mycroft), or the interactions between various groupings of these characters }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\topics).  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This likely follows from the frequency with which these terms appeared in the episode annotations.  }\DIFaddend Several of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{identified }\DIFaddend topics were highly similar, which we hypothesized might allow us to distinguish between subtle narrative differences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend if the distinctions between those overlapping topics were meaningful\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; also see Fig.  ~\featureimportance).  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.  }\DIFaddend The topic vectors for each timepoint were \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend \textit{sparse}, in that only a small number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(usually }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of topics (typically }\DIFaddend one or two) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of topics }\DIFdelend tended to be ``active'' in any given timepoint (Fig.~\ref{fig:model}A).  Further, the dynamics of the topic activations appeared to exhibit \textit{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{persistance}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{persistence}\DIFaddend } (i.e., given that a topic was active in one timepoint, it was likely to be active in the following timepoint) along with \textit{occasional rapid changes} (i.e., occasionally \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{topics would appear to spring into or out of existence}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{topic weights would change abruptly from one timepoint to the next}\DIFaddend ).  These two properties of the topic dynamics may be seen in the block diagonal structure of the timepoint-by-timepoint correlation matrix (Fig.~\ref{fig:model}B) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.  Following \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Given that the time-varying content of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend could be segmented cleanly into discrete events, we wondered whether participants' recalls of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend also displayed a similar structure.  We applied the same topic model (already trained on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend annotations) to each participant's recalls.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Analogous }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Analogously }\DIFaddend to how we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analyzed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{parsed }\DIFaddend the time-varying content of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode}\DIFaddend , to obtain similar estimates for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{participants'recalls}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{each participant's recall transcript}\DIFaddend , we treated each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(overlapping  ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{overlapping  window of (up to) }\DIFaddend 10 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sentence ``window '' of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sentences from }\DIFaddend their transcript as a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``document'' and then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{document, and }\DIFaddend computed the most probable mix of topics reflected in each timepoint's sentences.  This yielded, for each participant, a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{number-of-sentences }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{number-of-windows }\DIFaddend by number-of-topics topic proportions matrix that characterized how the topics identified in the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend were reflected in the participant's recalls.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Note that an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An }\DIFaddend important feature of our approach is that it allows us to compare \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{participant' s }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{participants' }\DIFaddend recalls to events from the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode}\DIFaddend , despite that different participants \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may have used different }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used widely varying }\DIFaddend language to describe the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{same event}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{events}\DIFaddend , and that those descriptions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may not match the original }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{often diverged in content, quality, and quantity from the episode }\DIFaddend annotations.  This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is a huge }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ability to match up conceptually related text that differs in specific vocabulary, detail, and length is an important }\DIFaddend benefit of projecting the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend and recalls into a shared \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``topic '' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{topic }\DIFaddend space.  An example topic proportions matrix from one participant's recalls is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model}D.

Although the example participant's recall topic proportions matrix has some visual similarity to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend topic proportions matrix, the time-varying topic proportions for the example participant's recalls are not as sparse as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for the video (e.g., }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{those for the episode (}\DIFaddend compare Figs.~\ref{fig:model}A and D).  Similarly, although there do appear to be periods of stability in the recall topic dynamics (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{e.g.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{i.e.}\DIFaddend , most topics are active or inactive over contiguous blocks of time), the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{overall timecourses are not as cleanly delineated as the video topics are}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes in topic activations that define event boundaries appear less clearly delineated in participants' recalls than in the episode's annotations}\DIFaddend .  To examine these patterns in detail, we computed the timepoint-by-timepoint correlation matrix for the example participant's recall topic proportions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{matrix }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:model}E).  As in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend correlation matrix (Fig.~\ref{fig:model}B), the example participant's recall correlation matrix has a strong block diagonal structure, indicating that their recalls are discretized into separated events.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As for the video correlation matrix, we can use an HMM, along with the aforementioned number-of-events optimization procedure (also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We used the same HMM-based optimization procedure that we had applied to the episode's topic proportions matrix (}\DIFaddend see \textit{Methods}) to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{determine how many events are reflected }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimate an analogous set of event boundaries }\DIFaddend in the participant's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recalls and where specifically the event boundaries fall }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recounting of the episode }\DIFaddend (outlined in yellow).  We carried out \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a similar }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this }\DIFaddend analysis on all 17 participants' recall topic proportions matrices (Fig.~\corrmats).

Two clear patterns emerged from this set of analyses.  First, although every individual participant's recalls could be segmented into discrete events (i.e., every individual participant's recall correlation matrix exhibited clear block diagonal structure; Fig.~\corrmats), each participant appeared to have a unique \textit{recall resolution}, reflected in the sizes of those blocks.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For example, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{While }\DIFaddend some participants' recall topic proportions segmented into just a few events (e.g., Participants \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{P1, }\DIFdelend P4, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and P15), while others' recalls }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{P5, and P7), others' }\DIFaddend segmented into many \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{shorter duration }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shorter-duration }\DIFaddend events (e.g., Participants P12, P13, and P17).  This suggests that different participants may be recalling the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend with different levels of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{detail-- e.g.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{detail---i.e.}\DIFaddend , some might \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{touch on just the major plot points}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recount only high-level essential plot details}\DIFaddend , whereas others might \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attempt to recall every minor scene}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recount low-level details instead (or in addition)}\DIFaddend .  The second clear pattern present in every individual participant's recall correlation matrix \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend that, unlike in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend correlation matrix, there \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend substantial off-diagonal correlations\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in participant's recalls}\DIFdelend .  Whereas each event in the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video (was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode was (}\DIFaddend largely) separable from the others (Fig.~\ref{fig:model}B), in transforming those separable events into memory\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{participants appear }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, participants appeared }\DIFaddend to be integrating \DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{across}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{different }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across multiple }\DIFaddend events, blending elements of previously recalled and not-yet-recalled \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{events }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{content }\DIFaddend into each newly recalled event~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[Figs.~\ref{fig:model}D, \corrmats; also see][]{MannEtal11, HowaEtal12}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[Figs.~\ref{fig:model}E, \corrmats; also see][]{MannEtal11, HowaEtal12, Mann19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

The above results \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{indicate that both the structure of the original video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{demonstrate that topic models capture the dynamic conceptual content of the episode }\DIFaddend and participants' recalls of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode.  Further, the episode and recalls }\DIFaddend exhibit event boundaries that can be identified automatically \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by characterizing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using HMMs to segment }\DIFaddend the dynamic content\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using a shared topic model and segmenting the content into events using HMMs.  Next}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.  Next, }\DIFaddend we asked whether some correspondence might be made between the specific content of the events the participants experienced \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{while viewing the episode}\DIFaddend , and the events they later recalled.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{One approach to linking the experienced (video) and recalled events is to label each recalled }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We labeled each recall }\DIFaddend event as matching the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend event with the most similar (i.e., most highly correlated) topic vector (Figs.~\ref{fig:model}G, \matchmats).  This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{yields }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{yielded }\DIFaddend a sequence of ``presented'' events from the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode}\DIFaddend , and a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sequence of }\DIFdelend (potentially differently ordered) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sequence of }\DIFaddend ``recalled'' events for each participant.  Analogous to classic list-learning studies, we can then examine participants' recall sequences by asking which events they tended to recall first~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{literature.  For example, participants had a higher probability of initiating recall with early events (Fig.~\ref{fig:list-learning}A) and a higher probability of transitioning to neighboring events with an asymmetric forward bias (Fig.~\ref{fig:list-learning}B). However, unlike what is typically observed in list-learning studies, we did not observe patterns comparable to the primacy or recency serial position effects (Fig.~\ref{fig:list-learning}C).  We hypothesized that participants might be leveraging meaningful narrative associations and references over long timescales throughout the episode.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The dynamic content of the video and participants'recalls is quantified in the corresponding topic proportion matrices.  However, it is difficult to gain deep insights into that content solely by examining the topic proportion matrices (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Clustering scores are often used by memory researchers to characterize how people organize their memories of words on a studied list~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Temporal clustering refers to the extent to which participants group their recall responses according to encoding position.  Overall, we found that sequentially viewed episode events tended to appear nearby in participants' recall event sequences (mean clustering score: 0.732, SEM: 0.033).  Participants with higher temporal clustering scores tended to exhibit better overall memory for the episode, according to both \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

Semantic clustering measures the extent to which participants cluster their recall responses according to semantic similarity.  We found that participants tended to recall semantically similar episode events together (mean clustering score: 0.650, SEM: 0.032), and that semantic clustering score was also related to both hand-counted  (Pearson's $r(15) = 0.65,~p = 0.005$) and model-estimated (Pearson's $r(15) = 0.58,~p = 0.015$) numbers of recalled events.

\DIFadd{The above analyses illustrate how our framework for characterizing the dynamic conceptual content of naturalistic episodes enables us to carry out analyses that have traditionally been applied to much simpler list-learning paradigms.  However, perhaps the most interesting aspects of memory for naturalistic episodes are those that have no list-learning analogs.  The nuances of how one's memory for an event might capture some details, yet distort or neglect others, is central to how we use our memory systems in daily life.  Yet when researchers study memory in highly simplified paradigms, those nuances are not typically observable.  We next developed two novel, continuous metrics, termed }\textit{\DIFadd{precision}} \DIFadd{and }\textit{\DIFadd{distinctiveness}}\DIFadd{, aimed at characterizing distortions in the conceptual content of individual recall events, and the conceptual overlap between how people described different events.
}

\textit{\DIFadd{Precision}} \DIFadd{is intended to capture the ``completeness'' of recall, or how fully the presented content was recapitulated in a participant's recounting.  We define a recall event's precision as the maximum correlation between the topic proportions of that recall event and any episode event (Fig.~\ref{fig:precision-distinctiveness}).  In other words, given that a recall event best matches a particular episode event, more precisely recalled events overlap more strongly with the conceptual content of the original episode event.  When a given event is assigned a blend of several topics, as is often the case (Fig.~\ref{fig:model}), a high precision score requires recapitulating the relative topic proportions during recall.
}

\textit{\DIFadd{Distinctiveness}} \DIFadd{is intended to capture the ``specificity'' of recall.  In other words, distinctiveness quantifies the extent to which a given recall event reflects the most similar episode event over and above other episode events.  Intuitively, distinctiveness is like a normalized variant of our precision metric.  Whereas precision solely measures how much detail about an episode was captured in someone's recall, distinctiveness penalizes details that also pertain to other episode events.  We define the distinctiveness of an event's recall as its precision expressed in standard deviation units with respect to other episode events.  Specifically, for a given recall event, we compute the correlation between its topic vector and that of each episode event.  This yields a distribution of correlation coefficients (one per episode event).  We subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation of this distribution to $z$-score the coefficients.  The maximum value in this distribution (which, by definition, belongs to the episode event that best matches the given recall event) is that recall event's distinctiveness score.  In this way, recall events that match one episode event far better than all other episode events will receive a high distinctiveness score.  By contrast, a recall event that matches all episode events roughly equally will receive a comparatively low distinctiveness score.
}

\DIFadd{In addition to examining how precisely and distinctively participants recalled individual events, one may also use these metrics to summarize each participant's performance by averaging across a participant's event-wise precision or distinctiveness scores.  This enables us to quantify how precisely a participant tended to recall subtle within-event details, as well as how specific (distinctive) those details were to individual events from the episode.  Participants' average precision and distinctiveness scores were strongly correlated ($r(15) = 0.90, p < 0.001$).  This indicates that participants who tended to precisely recount low-level details of episode events also tended to do so in an event-specific way (}\DIFaddend e.g., \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figs.  ~\ref{fig:model}A, D) or the corresponding correlation matrices (Figs.~\ref{fig:model}B, E}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as opposed to detailing recurring themes that were present in most or all episode events; this behavior would have resulted in high precision but low distinctiveness).  We found that, across participants, higher precision scores were positively correlated with the numbers of both hand-annotated scenes ($r(15) = 0.60, p = 0.010$) and model-estimated events ($r(15) = 0.90, p < 0.001$) that participants recalled.  Participants' average distinctiveness scores were also correlated with both the hand-annotated ($r(15) = 0.45, p = 0.068$) and model-estimated ($r(15) = 0.71, p = 0.001$) numbers of recalled events.

\DIFadd{Examining individual recalls of the same episode event can provide insights into how the above precision and distinctiveness scores may be used to characterize similarities and differences in how different people describe the same shared experience.  In Figure \ref{fig:precision-detail}, we compare recalls for the same episode event from the participants with the highest (P17) and lowest (P6) precision scores.  From the HMM-identified episode event boundaries, we recovered the set of annotations describing the content of a single episode event (event 21; Fig.~\ref{fig:precision-detail}C), and divided them into different color-coded sections for each action or feature described.  Next, we used an analogous approach to identify the set of sentences comprising the corresponding recall event from each of the two example participants (Fig.~\ref{fig:precision-detail}D).  We then colored all words describing actions and features in the transcripts shown in Panel D according to the color-coded annotations in Panel C.  Visual comparison of these example recalls reveals that the more precise recall captures more of the episode event's content, and in greater detail.
}

\DIFadd{Figure \ref{fig:precision-detail} also illustrates the differences between high and low distinctiveness scores.  We extracted the set of sentences comprising the most distinctive recall event (P9) and least distinctive recall event (P6) corresponding to the example episode event shown in Panel C (event 21).  We also extracted the annotations for all episode events whose content these participants' single recall events described.  We assigned each episode event a unique color (Fig.~\ref{fig:precision-detail}E), and colored each recalled sentence (Panel F) according to the episode events they best matched.  Visual inspection of Panel F reveals that the most distinctive recall's content is tightly concentrated around event 21, whereas the least distinctive recall incorporates content from a much wider range of episode events.

\DIFadd{The preceding analyses sought to characterize how participants' recountings of individual episode events captured the low-level details of each event.  Next, we sought to characterize how participants' recountings of the full episode captured its high-level essence---i.e., the shape of the episode's trajectory through word embedding (topic) space.

Visual inspection of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend and recall topic trajectories reveals a striking pattern.  First, the topic trajectory of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend (which reflects its dynamic content; Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}A) is captured nearly perfectly by the averaged topic trajectories of participants' recalls (Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}B).  To assess the consistency of these recall trajectories across participants, we asked: given that a participant's recall trajectory had entered a particular location in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the reduced }\DIFaddend topic space, could the position of their \textit{next} recalled event be predicted reliably?  For each location in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the reduced }\DIFaddend topic space, we computed the set of line segments connecting successively recalled events (across all participants) that intersected that location (see \textit{Methods}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for additional details}\DIFdelend ).  We then computed (for each location) the distribution of angles formed by the lines defined by those line segments and a fixed reference line (the $x$-axis).  Rayleigh tests revealed the set of locations in topic space at which these across-participant distributions exhibited reliable peaks (blue arrows in Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}B reflect significant peaks at $p < 0.05$, corrected).  We observed that the locations traversed by nearly the entire \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend trajectory exhibited such peaks.  In other words, participants\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{' recalls }\DIFaddend exhibited similar trajectories \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to each other }\DIFaddend that also matched the trajectory of the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}C).  This is especially notable when considering the fact that the number of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{events participants recalled }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{HMM-identified recall events }\DIFaddend (dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}C) varied considerably across people, and that every participant used different words to describe what they had remembered happening in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode}\DIFaddend .  Differences in the numbers of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{remembered }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recall }\DIFaddend events appear in participants' trajectories as differences in the sampling resolution along the trajectory.  We note that this framework also provides a means of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{detangling }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{disentangling }\DIFaddend classic ``proportion recalled'' measures (i.e., the proportion of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video events referenced }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode events described }\DIFaddend in participants' recalls) from participants' abilities to recapitulate the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{full gist of the original video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode's essence }\DIFaddend (i.e., the similarity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the shape }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between the shapes }\DIFaddend of the original \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend trajectory and that defined by each participant's recounting of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode}\DIFaddend ).

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In addition to enabling us to visualize the episode's high-level essence, describing the episode as a geometric trajectory also enables us to drill down to individual words and quantify how each word relates to the memorability of each event.  This provides another approach to examining participants' recall for low-level details beyond the precision and distinctiveness measures we defined above.  The results displayed in Figures \ref{fig:list-learning}C and \ref{fig:precision-detail}A suggest that certain events were remembered better than others.  Given this, we next asked asked whether the events that were generally remembered precisely or imprecisely tended to reflect particular content.  }\DIFaddend Because our analysis framework projects the dynamic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend content and participants' recalls \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{onto a shared topic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{into a shared }\DIFaddend space, and because the dimensions of that space \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are known (i.e., each topic dimension is a set }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{represent topics (which are, in turn, sets }\DIFaddend of weights over \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{known }\DIFaddend words in the vocabulary\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; Fig.~\topics}\DIFdelend ), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can examine the topic trajectories to understand which specific content was remembered well (or poorly).For each video event, we can ask: what was the average correlation (across participants) between the video event's topic vectorand the closest matching recall event topic vectors from each participant?

We first computed the average precision with which participants recalled each of the 30 episode events }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:topics}A\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{).  (We also examined how different comparisons between each video event's topic vector and the corresponding recall event topic vectors related to hand-annotated characterizations of memory performance; see }\textit{\DIFdel{Supporting Information}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{).  Given this summary of which events were recalled reliably (or not), we next asked whether the better-remembered or worse-remembered events tended to reflect particular topics.  We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; note that this result is analogous to a serial position curve created from our precision metric).  We then }\DIFaddend computed a weighted average of the topic vectors for each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend event, where the weights reflected how \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reliably }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{precisely }\DIFaddend each event was recalled.  To visualize the result, we created a ``wordle'' image~\citep{MuelEtal18} where words weighted more heavily by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{better-remembered }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more precisely-remembered }\DIFaddend topics appear in a larger font (Fig.~\ref{fig:topics}B, green box).  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Events that reflected topics weighting heavily on characters like ``Sherlock'' and ``John'' (i.e., the main characters) and locations like ``221b Baker Street'' (i.e.,a major recurring location }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Across the full episode, content that weighted heavily on topics and words central to the major foci of the episode (e.g., the names of the two main characters, ``Sherlock'' and ``John,'' }\DIFaddend and the address of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the flat that Sherlock and John share) were }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a major recurring location, ``221B Baker Street'') was }\DIFaddend best remembered.  An analogous analysis revealed which themes were \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{poorly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{less-precisely }\DIFaddend remembered.  Here in computing the weighted average over events' topic vectors\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we weighted each event in \textit{inverse} proportion to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{how well it was remembered }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its average precision }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:topics}B, red box).  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This revealed that events with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The least precisely remembered episode content reflected information that was extraneous to the episode's essence, such as the proper names of }\DIFaddend relatively minor characters \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(e.g., }\DIFaddend ``Mike,'' ``\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Jeffrey}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Molly}\DIFaddend ,'' and ``\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Molly,''as well as less-integral plot }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Lestrade'') and }\DIFaddend locations (e.g., ``\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hospital'' and ``office'') were least well-remembered.

\label{sec:discussion}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Explicitly modeling the dynamic content of a naturalistic stimulus and participants' memories enabled us to connect the present study of naturalistic recall with an extensive prior literature that has used list-learning paradigms to study memory~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[for review see][]{Kaha12}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, as in Figure~\ref{fig:list-learning}.  We found some similarities between how participants in the present study recounted a television episode and how participants typically recall memorized random word lists.  However, our broader claim is that word lists miss out on fundamental aspects of naturalistic memory more like the sort of memory we rely on in everyday life.  For example, there are no random word list analogs of character interactions, conceptual dependencies between temporally distant episode events, the sense of solving a mystery that pervades the }\textit{\DIFadd{Sherlock}} \DIFadd{episode, or the myriad other features of the episode that convey deep meaning and capture interest.  Nevertheless, each of these properties affects how people process and engage with the episode as they are watching it, and how they remember it later.  The overarching goal of the present study is to characterize how the rich dynamics of the episode affect the rich behavioral and neural dynamics of how people remember it.
}

\DIFaddend Our work casts remembering as reproducing (behaviorally and neurally) the topic trajectory, or ``\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gist}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shape}\DIFaddend ,'' of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the original experience.This view }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an experience.  When we characterized memory for a television episode using this framework, we found that every participant's recounting of the episode recapitulated the low spatial frequency details of the shape of its trajectory through topic space (Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}).  We termed this narrative scaffolding the episode's }\textit{\DIFadd{essence}}\DIFadd{.  Where participants' behaviors varied most was in their tendencies to recount specific low-level details from each episode event.  Geometrically, this appears as high spatial frequency distortions in participants' recall trajectories relative to the trajectory of the original episode (Fig.~\ref{fig:topics}).  We developed metrics to characterize the precision (recovery of any and all event-level information) and distinctiveness (recovery of event-specific information).  We also used word cloud visualizations to interpret the details of these event-level distortions.
}

\DIFadd{The neural analyses we carried out (Fig.~\ref{fig:brainz}) also leveraged our geometric framework for characterizing the shapes of the episode and participants' recountings.  We identified one network of regions whose responses tracked with temporal correlations in the conceptual content of the episode (as quantified by topic models applied to a set of annotations about the episode).  This network included orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and striatum, among others.  As reviewed by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{RangRitc12}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, several of these regions are members of the }\textit{\DIFadd{anterior temporal system}}\DIFadd{, which has been implicated in assessing and processing the familiarity of ongoing experiences, emotions, social cognition, and reward.  A second network we identified tracked with temporal correlations in the idiosyncratic conceptual content of participants' subsequent recountings of the episode.  This network included occipital cortex, extrastriate cortex, fusiform gyrus, and the precuneus.  Several of these regions are members of the }\textit{\DIFadd{posterior medial system}}\DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{RangRitc12}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, which has been implicated in matching incoming cues about the current situation to internally maintained }\textit{\DIFadd{situation models}} \DIFadd{that specify the parameters and expectations inherent to the current situation~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[also see][]{ZackEtal07, ZwaaRadv98}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  Taken together, our results support the notion that these two (partially overlapping) networks work in coordination to make sense of our ongoing experiences, distort them in a way that links them with our prior knowledge and experiences, and encodes those distorted representations into memory for our later use.
}

\DIFadd{Our general approach }\DIFaddend draws inspiration from prior work aimed at elucidating the neural and behavioral underpinnings of how we process dynamic naturalistic experiences and remember them later.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{One }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our }\DIFaddend approach to identifying neural responses to naturalistic stimuli (including experiences) entails building \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an explicit }\DIFaddend model of the stimulus \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dynamics }\DIFaddend and searching for brain regions whose responses are consistent with the model\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[also see][]{HuthEtal12, HuthEtal16}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  In prior work, a series of studies from Uri Hasson's group~\citep{LernEtal11, SimoEtal16, ChenEtal17, BaldEtal17, ZadbEtal17} have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extended this approach with a clever twist.  Rather }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{presented a clever alternative approach: rather }\DIFaddend than building an explicit stimulus model, these studies instead search for brain responses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(while experiencing the stimulus ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to the stimulus }\DIFaddend that are reliably similar across individuals.  So called \textit{inter-subject correlation} (ISC) and \textit{inter-subject functional connectivity} (ISFC) analyses effectively treat other people's brain responses to the stimulus as a ``model'' of how its features change over time\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.  By contrast, in our present work we used topic models and HMMs to construct an explicit stimulus model (i.e., the topic trajectory of the video).  When we searched for brain structures whose responses are consistent with the video's topic trajectory, we identified a network of structures that overlapped strongly with the ``long temporal receptive window'' network reported by the Hasson group~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g., compare our Fig.~\ref{fig:brainz}A with the map of long temporal receptive window voxels in][]{LernEtal11}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  This provides support for the notion that part of the long temporal receptive window network may be maintaining an explicit model of the stimulus dynamics.  When we performed a similar analysis after swapping out the video's topic trajectory with the recall topic trajectories of each individual participant, this allowed us to identify brain regions whose responses (as the participants viewed the video) reflected how the video trajectory would be transformed in memory (as reflected by the recall topic trajectories).  The analysis revealed that the rMTL and vmPFC may play a role in this person-specific transformation from experience into memory.  The role of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[also see][]{SimoChan20}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  These purely brain-driven approaches are well suited to identifying which brain structures exhibit similar stimulus-driven responses across individuals.  Further, because neural response dynamics are observed data (rather than model approximations), such approaches do not require a detailed understanding of which stimulus properties or features might be driving the observed responses.  However, this also means that }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{MTL in episodic memory encoding has been well-reported~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g., ][]{PallWagn02, DavaEtAl03, RangEtal04, Dava06}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  Prior work has also implicated the medial prefrontal cortex in representing ``schema'' knowledge~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[i.e., general knowledge about the format of an ongoing experience given prior similar experiences; ][]{KestEtal12, SchlPres15, GilbMarl17, SpalEtal18}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  Integrating across our study and this prior work, one interpretation is that the person-specific transformations mediated (or represented) by the rMTL and vmPFC may reflect schema knowledge being leveraged, formed, or updated, incorporating ongoing experience into previously acquired knowledge.  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{specific stimulus features driving those responses are typically opaque to the researcher.  Our approach is complementary.  By explicitly modeling the stimulus dynamics, we are able to relate specific stimulus features to behavioral and neural dynamics.  However, when our model fails to accurately capture the stimulus dynamics that are truly driving behavioral and neural responses, our approach necessarily yields an incomplete characterization of the neural basis of the processes we are studying.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Other recent work has used HMMs to discover latent event structure in neural responses to naturalistic stimuli~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{BaldEtal17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  By applying HMMs to our explicit models of stimulus and memory dynamics, we gain a more direct understanding of those state dynamics.  For example, we found that although the events comprising each participant's recalls recapitulated the episode's essence, participants differed in the }\textit{\DIFadd{resolution}} \DIFadd{of their recounting of low-level details.  In turn, these individual behavioral differences were reflected in differences in neural activity dynamics as participants watched the television episode.
}

\DIFadd{Our approach also draws inspiration from the growing field of word embedding models.  The topic models~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{BleiEtal03} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
we used to embed text from the episode annotations and participants' recall transcripts are just one of many models that have been studied in an extensive literature.  The earliest approaches to word embedding, including latent
semantic analysis~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{LandDuma97}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, used word co-occurrence statistics (i.e., how often pairs of words occur in the same documents contained in the corpus) to derive a unique feature vector for each word.  The feature vectors are constructed so that words that co-occur more frequently have feature vectors that are closer (in Euclidean distance).  Topic models are essentially an extension of those early models, in that they attempt to explicitly model the underlying causes of word co-occurrences by automatically identifying the set of themes or topics reflected across the documents in the corpus.  More recent work on these types of semantic models, including word2vec~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{MikoEtal13}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, the Universal Sentence Encoder~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{CerEtal18}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, GPT-2~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{RadfEtal19}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, and GTP-3~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{BrowEtal20} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
use deep neural networks to attempt to identify the deeper conceptual representations underlying each word.  Despite the growing popularity of these sophisticated deep learning-based embedding models, we chose to prioritize interpretability of the embedding dimensions (e.g., Fig.~\ref{fig:topics}) over raw performance (e.g., with respect to some predefined benchmark).  Nevertheless, we note that our general framework is, in principle, robust to the specific choice of language model as well as other aspects of our computational pipeline.  For example, the word embedding model, timeseries segmentation model, and the episode-recall matching function could each be customized to suit a particular question space or application.  Indeed, for some questions, interpretability of the embeddings may not be a priority, and thus other text embedding approaches (including the deep learning-based models described above) may be preferable.  Further work will be needed to explore the influence of particular models on our framework's predictions and performance.
}

\DIFaddend Our work has broad implications for how we characterize and assess memory in real-world settings\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend such as the classroom or physician's office.  For example, the most commonly used classroom evaluation tools involve \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simply }\DIFaddend computing the proportion of correctly answered exam questions.  Our work indicates that this approach is only loosely related to what educators might really want to measure: how well did the students understand the key ideas presented in the course?  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{One could apply the computational framework we developed to construct topic trajectories for the video and participants' recalls to build explicit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Under this typical framework of assessment, the same exam score of 50\% could be ascribed to two very different students: one who attended to the full course but struggled to learn more than a broad overview of the material, and one who attended to only half of the course but understood the attended material perfectly.  Instead, one could apply our computational framework to build explicit dynamic }\DIFaddend content models of the course material and exam questions.  This approach would provide a more nuanced and specific view into which aspects of the material students had learned well (or poorly).  In clinical settings, memory measures that incorporate such explicit content models might also provide more direct evaluations of patients' memories\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and of doctor-patient interactions}\DIFaddend .


\section*{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection*{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Experimental design }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Paradigm }\DIFaddend and data collection}
Data were collected by \cite{ChenEtal17}.  In brief, participants (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$n=17$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$n=22$}\DIFaddend ) viewed the first 48 minutes of ``A Study in Pink\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'',}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,'' }\DIFaddend the first episode of the BBC television \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{series }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{show }\DIFaddend \textit{Sherlock}, while fMRI volumes were collected (TR = 1500~ms).  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Participants were pre-screened to ensure they had never seen any episode of the show before.  }\DIFaddend The stimulus was divided into a 23~min (946~TR) and a 25~min (1030~TR) segment to mitigate technical issues related to the scanner.  After finishing the clip, participants were instructed to \citep[quoting from][]{ChenEtal17} ``describe what they recalled of the [episode] in as much detail as they could, to try to recount events in the original order they were viewed in, and to speak for at least 10 minutes if possible but that longer was better. They were told that completeness and detail were more important than temporal order, and that if at any point they realized they had missed something, to return to it. Participants were then allowed to speak for as long as they wished, and verbally indicated when they were finished (e.g., `I’m done').''  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Five participants were dropped from the original dataset due to excessive head motion (2 participants), insufficient recall length (2 participants), or falling asleep during stimulus viewing (1 participant), resulting in a final sample size of $n=17$.  }\DIFaddend For additional details about the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{experimental procedure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{testing procedures }\DIFaddend and scanning parameters\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend see \cite{ChenEtal17}.  The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{experimental }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{testing }\DIFaddend protocol was approved by Princeton University's Institutional Review Board.

After preprocessing the fMRI data and warping the images into a standard (3~mm$^3$ MNI) space, the voxel activations were $z$-scored (within voxel) and spatially smoothed using a 6~mm (full width at half maximum) Gaussian kernel.  The fMRI data were also cropped so that all \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video-viewing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode-viewing }\DIFaddend data were aligned across participants.  This included a constant 3 TR (4.5~s) shift to account for the lag in the hemodynamic response.  \citep[All of these preprocessing steps followed][where additional details may be found.]{ChenEtal17}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The video stimulus was divided into 1,000 fine-grained ``time segments'' and annotated by an independent coder.  For each of these 1,000 annotations, the following information was recorded: a brief narrative description of what was happening, the location where the time segment took place, whether that location was indoors or outdoors, the names of all characters on-screen, the name(s) of the character(s) in focus in the shot, the name(s) of the character(s) currently speaking, the camera angle of the shot, a transcription of any text appearing on-screen, and whether or not there was music present in the background.  Each time segment was also tagged with its onset and offset time, in both seconds and TRs.

\subsection*{Statistics}
All statistical tests \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we performed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{performed in the behavioral analyses }\DIFaddend were two-sided.  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{All statistical tests performed in the neural data analyses were two-sided, except for the permutation-based thresholding, which was one-sided.

\subsection*{Modeling the dynamic content of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend and recall transcripts}
\subsubsection*{Topic modeling}
The input to the topic model we trained to characterize the dynamic content of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video comprised }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode comprised 998 }\DIFaddend hand-generated annotations of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{each of 1000 scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{short (mean: 2.96s) time segments }\DIFaddend spanning the video clip~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[generated by][]{ChenEtal17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  The features included: narrative details (a sentence or two describing what happened in that scene); whether the scene took place indoors or outdoors; names of any characters that appeared in the scene; name(s) of characters in camera focus; name(s) of characters who were speaking in the scene; the location (in the story)that the scene took place; camera angle (close up, medium, long, top, tracking, over the shoulder, etc.  ); whether music was playing in the scene or not; and a transcription of any on-screen text.  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citealp{ChenEtal17} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
generated 1000 annotations total; we removed two annotations referring to a break between the first and second scan sessions, during which no fMRI data were collected).  }\DIFaddend We concatenated the text for all of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the annotated }\DIFaddend features within each segment, creating a ``bag of words'' describing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{each scene.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its content and performed some minor preprocessing (e.g., stemming possessive nouns and removing punctuation).  }\DIFaddend We then re-organized the text descriptions into overlapping sliding windows spanning \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(up to) }\DIFaddend 50 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{annotations }\DIFaddend each.  In other words, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the first text sample comprised the combined text from the first 50 scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we estimated the ``context'' for each annotated segment using the text descriptions of the preceding 25 annotations, the present annotations, and the following 24 annotations.  To model the context for annotations near the beginning of the episode }\DIFaddend (i.e., \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1--50), the second comprised the text from scenes 2--51, and so on.  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within 25 of the beginning or end), we created overlapping sliding windows that grew in size from one annotation to the full length.  We also tapered the sliding window lengths at the end of the episode, whereby time segments within fewer than 24 annotations of the end of the episode were assigned sliding windows that extended to the end of the episode.  This procedure ensured that each annotation's content was represented in the text corpus an equal number of times.
}

\DIFaddend We trained our model using these overlapping text samples with \texttt{scikit-learn}~\citep[version 0.19.1; ][]{PedrEtal11}, called from our high-dimensional visualization and text analysis software, \texttt{HyperTools}~\citep{HeusEtal18a}.  Specifically, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend the \texttt{CountVectorizer} class to transform the text from each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scene }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{window }\DIFaddend into a vector of word counts (using the union of all words across all \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{annotations }\DIFaddend as the ``vocabulary,'' excluding English stop words); this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{yields a number-of-scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{yielded a number-of-windows }\DIFaddend by number-of-words \textit{word count} matrix.  We then \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend the \texttt{LatentDirichletAllocation} class (topics=100, method=`batch') to fit a topic model~\citep{BleiEtal03} to the word count matrix, yielding a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{number-of-scenes (1000}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{number-of-windows (1047}\DIFaddend ) by number-of-topics (100) \textit{topic proportions} matrix.  The topic proportions matrix describes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the gradually evolving }\DIFaddend mix of topics (latent themes) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend present in each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scene}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{annotated time segment of the episode}\DIFaddend .  Next, we transformed the topic proportions matrix to match the 1976 fMRI volume acquisition times.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For each fMRI volume, we took the topic proportions from whatever scene was displayed for most of that volume's 1500~ms acquisition time.  This yielded a new }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We assigned each topic vector to the timepoint (in seconds) midway between the beginning of the first annotation and the end of the last annotation in its corresponding sliding text window.  By doing so, we warped the linear temporal distance between consecutive topic vectors to align with the inconsistent temporal distance between consecutive annotations (whose durations varied greatly).  We then rescaled these timepoints to 1.5s TR units, and used linear interpolation to estimate a topic vector for each TR.  This resulted in a }\DIFaddend number-of-TRs (1976) by number-of-topics (100) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{topic proportions }\DIFdelend matrix.

We created similar topic proportions matrices using hand-annotated transcripts of each participant's \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{verbal }\DIFaddend recall of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[annotated by][]{ChenEtal17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  We tokenized the transcript into a list of sentences, and then re-organized the list into overlapping sliding windows spanning \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(up to) }\DIFaddend 10 sentences each\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; in turn}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, analogously to how we parsed the episode annotations.  In turn, }\DIFaddend we transformed each window's sentences into a word count vector (using the same vocabulary as for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video model).  We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode model), }\DIFaddend then used the topic model already trained on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend scenes to compute the most probable topic proportions for each sliding window.  This yielded a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{number-of-sentences }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{number-of-windows }\DIFaddend (range: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{68--294}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{83--312}\DIFaddend ) by number-of-topics (100) topic proportions matrix \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend for each participant.  These reflected the dynamic content of each participant's recalls.  Note: for details on how we selected the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend and recall window lengths and number of topics, see \textit{Supporting Information} and Figure~\topicopt.


\subsubsection*{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Parsing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Segmenting }\DIFaddend topic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectories }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proportions matrices }\DIFaddend into \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discrete }\DIFaddend events using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hidden }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hidden }\DIFaddend Markov Models}
We parsed the topic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectories of the video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proportions matrices of the episode }\DIFaddend and participants' recalls into \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{events using Hidden }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discrete events using hidden }\DIFaddend Markov Models~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[HMMs;][]{Rabi89}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  Given the topic proportions matrix (describing the mix of topics at each timepoint) and a number of states, $K$, an HMM recovers the set of state transitions that segments the timeseries into $K$ discrete states.  Following \cite{BaldEtal17}, we imposed an additional set of constraints on the discovered state transitions that ensured that each state was encountered exactly once (i.e., never repeated).  We used the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{BrainIAK }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \texttt{\DIFadd{BrainIAK}} \DIFaddend toolbox~\citep{Brainiak} to implement this segmentation.

We used an optimization procedure to select the appropriate $K$ for each topic proportions matrix.  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Prior studies on narrative structure and processing have shown that we both perceive and internally represent the world around us at multiple, hierarchical timescales \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

However, for the purposes of our framework, we sought to identify the single timeseries of event-representations that is emphasized }\textit{\DIFadd{most heavily}} \DIFadd{in the temporal structure of the episode and of each participant's recall.  We quantified this as the set of $K$ states that maximized the similarity between topic vectors for timepoints comprising each state, while minimizing the similarity between topic vectors for timepoints across different states.  }\DIFaddend Specifically, we computed (for each matrix)
\[
  \argmax_K \left[\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\frac{a}{b} - \frac{K}{\alpha}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{W_{1}(a, b)}\DIFaddend \right],

where $a$ was the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{average correlation between the topic vectors of timepoints within the same state; }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distribution of within-state topic vector correlations, and }\DIFaddend $b$ was the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{average correlation between the topic vectors of timepoints within }\textit{\DIFdel{different}} %DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdel{We used the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Naturalistic extensions of classic list-learning analyses}}
\DIFadd{In traditional list-learning experiments, participants view a list of items (e.g., words) and then recall the items later.  Our episode-recall event matching approach affords us the ability to analyze memory in a similar way. The episode and recall events can be treated analogously to studied and recalled ``items'' in a list-learning study.  We can then extend classic analyses of memory performance and dynamics (originally designed for list-learning experiments) to the more naturalistic episode recall task used in this study.
}

\DIFadd{Perhaps the simplest and most widely used measure of memory performance is }\textit{\DIFadd{accuracy}}\DIFadd{---i.e., the proportion of studied (experienced) items (in this case, episode events) that the participant later remembered.  \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ChenEtal17} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
used this method to rate each participant's memory quality by computing the proportion of (50, manually identified) scenes mentioned in their recall.  We found a strong across-participants correlation between these independent ratings and the proportion of 30 HMM-identified episode events matched to participants' recalls (Pearson's $r(15) = 0.71, p = 0.002$).  We further considered a number of more nuanced memory performance measures that are typically associated with list-learning studies.  We also provide a software package, }\texttt{\DIFadd{Quail}}\DIFadd{, for carrying out these analyses~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\paragraph{\DIFadd{Probability of first recall (PFR).}}  \DIFadd{PFR curves~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{WelcBurn24, PostPhil65, AtkiShif68} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
reflect the probability that an item will be recalled first, as a function of its serial position during encoding. To carry out this analysis, we initialized a number-of-participants (17) by number-of-episode-events (30) matrix of zeros. Then, for each participant, we found the index of the episode event that was recalled first (i.e., the episode event whose topic vector was most strongly correlated with that of the first recall event) and filled in that index in the matrix with a 1.  Finally, we averaged over the rows of the matrix, resulting in a 1 by 30 array representing the proportion of participants that recalled an event first, as a function of the order of the event's appearance in the episode (Fig.~\ref{fig:list-learning}A).

\paragraph{\DIFadd{Lag conditional probability curve (lag-CRP).}} \DIFadd{The lag-CRP curve~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Kaha96} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
reflects the probability of recalling a given item after the just-recalled item, as a function of their relative encoding positions (or }\textit{\DIFadd{lag}}\DIFadd{).  In other words, a lag of 1 indicates that a recalled item was presented immediately after the previously recalled item, and a lag of -3 indicates that a recalled item came 3 items before the previously recalled item.  For each recall transition (following the first recall), we computed the lag between the current recall event and the next recall event, normalizing by the total number of possible transitions.  This yielded a number-of-participants (17) by number-of-lags (-29 to +29; 58 lags total excluding lags of 0) matrix. We averaged over the rows of this matrix to obtain a group-averaged lag-CRP curve (Fig.~\ref{fig:list-learning}B).
}

\paragraph{\DIFadd{Serial position curve (SPC).}} \DIFadd{SPCs~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Murd62a} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
reflect the proportion of participants that remember each item as a function of the item's serial position during encoding. We initialized a number-of-participants (17) by number-of-episode-events (30) matrix of zeros. Then, for each recalled event, for each participant, we found the index of the episode event that the recalled event most closely matched (via the correlation between the events' topic vectors) and entered a 1 into that position in the matrix. This resulted in a matrix whose entries indicated whether or not each event was recalled by each participant (depending on whether the corresponding entires were set to one or zero).  Finally, we averaged over the rows of the matrix to yield a 1 by 30 array representing the proportion of participants that recalled each event as a function of the events' order appearance in the episode (Fig.~\ref{fig:list-learning}C).
}

\paragraph{\DIFadd{Temporal clustering scores.}} \DIFadd{Temporal clustering describes a participant's tendency to organize their recall sequences by the learned items' encoding positions.  For instance, if a participant recalled the episode events in the exact order they occurred (or in exact reverse order), this would yield a score of 1.  If a participant recalled the events in random order, this would yield an expected score of 0.5.  For each recall event transition (and separately for each participant), we sorted all not-yet-recalled events according to their absolute lag (i.e., distance away in the episode).  We then computed the percentile rank of the next event the participant recalled.  We averaged these percentile ranks across all of the participant's recalls to obtain a single temporal clustering score for the participant.
}

\paragraph{\DIFadd{Semantic clustering scores.}} \DIFadd{Semantic clustering describes a participant's tendency to recall semantically similar presented items together in their recall sequences.  Here, we used the topic vectors for each event as a proxy for its semantic content. Thus, the similarity between the semantic content for two events can be computed by correlating their respective topic vectors.  For each recall event transition, we sorted all not-yet-recalled events according to how correlated the topic vector }\textit{\DIFadd{of the closest-matching episode event}} \DIFadd{was to the topic vector of the closest-matching episode event to the just-recalled event.  We then computed the percentile rank of the observed next recall.  We averaged these percentile ranks across all of the participant's recalls to obtain a single semantic clustering score for the participant.
}

\subsubsection*{\DIFadd{Averaging correlations}}
\DIFadd{In all instances where we performed statistical tests involving precision or distinctiveness scores (Fig.~\ref{fig:precision-detail}), we used the Fisher $z$-transformation~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Fish25} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
to stabilize the variance across the distribution of correlation values prior to performing the test.  Similarly, when averaging precision or distinctiveness scores, we $z$-transformed the scores prior to computing the mean, and inverse $z$-transformed the result.
}

\subsubsection*{\DIFadd{Visualizing the episode and recall topic trajectories}}
\DIFadd{We used the }\DIFaddend UMAP algorithm~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{McInHeal18} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{McInEtal18} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend to project the 100-dimensional topic space onto a two-dimensional space for visualization (Figs.~\ref{fig:trajectory}, \ref{fig:topics}).  To ensure that all of the trajectories were projected onto the \textit{same} lower dimensional space, we computed the low-dimensional embedding on a ``stacked'' matrix created by vertically concatenating the events-by-topics topic proportions matrices for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode, across-participants average recall }\DIFaddend and all 17 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{individual }\DIFaddend participants' recalls.  We then \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{divided }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{separated }\DIFaddend the rows of the result (a total-number-of-events by two matrix) back into \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{separate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{individual }\DIFaddend matrices for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video topic trajectory}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode topic trajectory, across-participant average recall trajectory, }\DIFaddend and the trajectories for each \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{individual }\DIFaddend participant's recalls (Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}).  This general approach for discovering a shared low-dimensional embedding for a collections of high-dimensional observations follows \cite{HeusEtal18a}.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We optimized the manifold space for visualization based on two criteria: First, that the 2D embedding of the episode trajectory should reflect its original 100-dimensional structure as faithfully as possible. Second, that the path traversed by the embedded episode trajectory should intersect itself a minimal number of times.  The first criteria helps bolster the validity of visual intuitions about relationships between sections of episode content, based on their locations in the embedding space.  The second criteria was motivated by the observed low off-diagonal values in the episode trajectory's temporal correlation matrix (suggesting that the same topic-space coordinates should not be revisited; see Fig.~2A). For further details on how we created this low-dimensional embedding space, see }\textit{\DIFadd{Supporting Information}}\DIFadd{.
}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection*{Estimating the consistency of flow through topic space across participants}
In Figure~\ref{fig:trajectory}B, we present an analysis aimed at characterizing locations in topic space that different participants move through in a consistent way (via their recall topic trajectories).  The two-dimensional topic space used in our visualizations (Fig.~\ref{fig:trajectory}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ranged from -5 to 5 (arbitrary ) unitsin the $x$ dimension and from -6.5 to 2 units in the $y$ dimension.  We divided this space into a grid of vertices spaced 0.25~unitsapart}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{comprised a $60 \times 60$ (arbitrary units) square.  We tiled this space with a $50 \times 50$ grid of evenly spaced vertices, and defined a circular area centered on each vertex whose radius was two times the distance between adjacent vertices (i.e., 2.4 units)}\DIFaddend .  For each vertex, we examined the set of line segments formed by connecting each pair successively recalled events, across all participants, that passed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{within 0.5 units}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{through this circle}\DIFaddend .  We computed the distribution of angles formed by those segments and the $x$-axis, and used a Rayleigh test to determine whether the distribution of angles was reliably ``peaked'' (i.e., consistent across all transitions that passed through that local portion of topic space).  To create Figure~\ref{fig:trajectory}B\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we drew an arrow originating from each grid vertex, pointing in the direction of the average angle formed by \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend line segments that passed within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.4 }\DIFaddend units.  We set the arrow lengths to be inversely proportional to the $p$-values of the Rayleigh tests at each vertex.  Specifically, for each vertex we converted all of the angles of segments that passed within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.4 }\DIFaddend units to unit vectors, and we set the arrow lengths at each vertex proportional to the length of the (circular) mean vector.  We also indicated any significant results ($p < 0.05$, corrected using the Benjamani-Hochberg procedure) by coloring the arrows in blue (darker blue denotes a lower $p$-value, i.e., a longer mean vector); all tests with $p \geq 0.05$ are displayed in gray and given a lower opacity value.

\subsection*{Searchlight fMRI analyses}
In Figure~\ref{fig:brainz}, we present two analyses aimed at identifying brain \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{structures }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regions }\DIFaddend whose responses (as participants viewed the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video) exhibited particular temporal correlations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode) exhibited a particular temporal structure}\DIFaddend .  We developed a searchlight analysis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{whereby }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wherein }\DIFaddend we constructed a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cube }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$5 \times 5 \times 5$ cube of voxels~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[following][]{ChenEtal17} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend centered on each voxel \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(radius: 5~voxels).  For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the brain, and for }\DIFaddend each of these cubes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we }\DIFdelend computed the temporal correlation matrix of the voxel responses during \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend viewing.  Specifically, for each of the 1976 volumes collected during \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend viewing, we correlated the activity patterns in the given cube with the activity patterns (in the same cube) collected during every other timepoint.  This yielded a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1976 by 1976 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$1976 \times 1976$ }\DIFaddend correlation matrix for each cube.  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Note: participant 5's scan ended 75s early, and in~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ChenEtal17}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
's publicly released dataset, their scan data was zero-padded to match the length of the other participants'.  For our searchlight analyses, we removed this padded data (i.e., the last 50 TRs), resulting in a $1925 \times 1925$ correlation matrix for each cube in participant 5's brain.
}\DIFaddend 

Next, we constructed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{two sets }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a series }\DIFaddend of ``template'' matrices\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{: one reflected the video}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.  The first template reflected the timecourse of the episode}\DIFaddend 's topic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectory and the other reflected }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proportions matrix, and the others reflected the timecourse of }\DIFaddend each participant's recall topic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectory}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proportions matrix}\DIFaddend .  To construct the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend template, we computed the correlations between the topic proportions estimated for every pair of TRs (prior to segmenting the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectory }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{topic proportions matrices }\DIFaddend into discrete events; i.e., the correlation matrix shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:model}B and \ref{fig:brainz}A).  We constructed similar temporal correlation matrices for each participant's recall topic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectory }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proportions matrix }\DIFaddend (Figs.~\ref{fig:model}D, \corrmats).  However, to correct for length differences and potential non-linear transformations between viewing time and recall time, we first used dynamic time warping~\citep{BernClif94} to temporally align participants' recall topic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trajectories with the video topic trajectory (an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proportions matrices with the episode topic proportions matrix.  An }\DIFaddend example correlation matrix before and after warping is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:brainz}B\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend .  This yielded a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1976 by 1976 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$1976 \times 1976$ }\DIFaddend correlation matrix for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend template and for each participant's recall template.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The temporal structure of the episode's content (as described by our model) is captured in the block-diagonal structure of the episode's temporal correlation matrix (e.g., Figs.~\ref{fig:model}B, \ref{fig:brainz}A), with time periods of thematic stability represented as dark blocks of varying sizes.  Inspecting the episode correlation matrix suggests that the episode's semantic content is highly temporally specific (i.e., the correlations between topic vectors from distant timepoints are almost all near zero).  By contrast, the activity patterns of individual (cubes of) voxels can encode relatively limited information on their own, and their activity frequently contributes to multiple separate functions \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{FreeEtal01, SigmDeha08, CharKoec10, RishEtal13}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.  By nature, these two attributes give rise to similarities in activity across large timescales that may not necessarily reflect a single task.  To enable a more sensitive analysis of brain regions whose shifts in activity patterns mirrored shifts in the semantic content of the episode or recalls, we restricted the temporal correlations we considered to the timescale of semantic information captured by our model.  Specifically, we isolated the upper triangle of the episode correlation matrix and created a ``proximal correlation mask'' that included only diagonals from the upper triangle of the episode correlation matrix up to the first diagonal that contained no positive correlations.  Applying this mask to the full episode correlation matrix was equivalent to excluding diagonals beyond the corner of the largest diagonal block.  In other words, the timescale of temporal correlations we considered corresponded to the longest period of thematic stability in the episode, and by extension the longest period of thematic stability in participants' recalls and the longest period of stability we might expect to see in voxel activity arising from processing or encoding episode content.  Figure \ref{fig:brainz} shows this proximal correlation mask applied to the temporal correlation matrices for the episode, an example participant's (warped) recall, and an example cube of voxels from our searchlight analyses.
}

\DIFaddend To determine which (cubes of) voxel responses \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reliably matched the video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{matched the episode }\DIFaddend template, we correlated the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proximal diagonals from the }\DIFaddend upper triangle of the voxel correlation matrix for each cube with the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{upper triangle of the video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proximal diagonals from episode }\DIFaddend template matrix~\citep{KrieEtal08b}.  This yielded, for each participant, a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{single correlation value.  We computed the average }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{voxelwise map of correlation values.  We then performed a one-sample $t$-test on the distribution of }\DIFaddend (Fisher $z$-transformed) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlation coefficient }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{correlations at each voxel, }\DIFaddend across participants.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We used a permutation-based procedureto assess significance}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This resulted in a value for each voxel (cube), describing how reliably its timecourse followed that of the episode.
}

\DIFadd{We further sought to ensure that our analysis identified regions where the activations’ temporal structure specifically reflected that of the episode, rather than regions whose activity was simply autocorrelated at a timescale similar to the episode template’s diagonal.  To achieve this, we used a phase shift-based permutation procedure}\DIFaddend , whereby we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{re-computed the average correlations for each of 100 ``null'' video templates (constructed by circularly shifting the template }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{circularly shifted the episode’s topic proportions matrix }\DIFaddend by a random number of timepoints \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(rows), computed the resulting ``null'' episode template, and re-ran the searchlight analysis, in full}\DIFaddend .  (For each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{permutation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the 100 permutations}\DIFaddend , the same \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{random }\DIFaddend shift was used for all participants\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.)We then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{).  We $z$-scored the observed (unshifted) result at each voxel against the distribution of permutation-derived ``null'' results, and }\DIFaddend estimated a $p$-value by computing the proportion of shifted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlations that were larger than the observed (unshifted) correlation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{results that yielded larger values}\DIFaddend .  To create the map in Figure~\ref{fig:brainz}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C, }\DIFaddend we thresholded out any voxels whose \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlation values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{similarity to the unshifted episode’s structure }\DIFaddend fell below the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of the permutation-derived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{null distribution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{similarity results}\DIFaddend .

We used \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a similar }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an analogous }\DIFaddend procedure to identify which voxels' responses reflected the recall templates.  For each participant, we correlated the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{proximal diagonals from the }\DIFaddend upper triangle of the correlation matrix for each cube of voxels with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{their (time warped}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the proximal diagonals from the upper triangle of their (time-warped}\DIFaddend ) recall correlation matrix.  As in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video template analysis}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode template analysis, }\DIFaddend this yielded a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{single correlation coefficient }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{voxelwise map of correlation coefficients }\DIFaddend for each participant.  However, whereas the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode }\DIFaddend analysis compared every participant's responses to the same template, here the recall templates were unique for each participant.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We computed the average }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As in the analysis described above, we $t$-scored the (Fisher }\DIFaddend $z$-transformed\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlation coefficient across participants}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) voxelwise correlations}\DIFaddend , and used the same permutation procedure we developed for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video responses to assess significant correlations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{episode responses to ensure specificity to the recall timeseries and assign significance values}\DIFaddend .  To create the map in Figure~\ref{fig:brainz}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{B we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{D we again }\DIFaddend thresholded out any voxels whose \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlation values fell }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{scores were }\DIFaddend below the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of the permutation-derived null distribution.
