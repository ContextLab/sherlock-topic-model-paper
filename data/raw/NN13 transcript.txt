So before the episode began, there's the cartoon for a movie theater specifically to get people to get snacks in the lobby. So there's a jingle, everyone go to the lobby and get ourselves a treat. And said the sparkling drinks are neat, then there's chocolate candy bars and popcorn. And there's a picture of the popcorn and a picture of the--well first it started off with life-size versions of the different treats walking on the stage. And then there's a picture of a family eating all the different movie snacks. And then it was, I think the snacks came on again, and then it ended with a picture of the slogan lets all go to the lobby and get ourselves a treat. And then it went into a war scene, we see soldiers in green, army green, and there's shooting and loud noises, and that lasted about 15 to 20 seconds. And then John Watson, or you don't know his name yet, but the character wakes up and he's sleeping and he sits up and is frustrated. And then the scene changes to him sitting in bed. And the next morning, just sitting there, kind of smiling with his hands out. And then it changes to him walking towards his desk with an apple and a coffee mug that has the British doctor's sign, I think it would be the military doctors' emblem. And he opens his laptop and it says Dr. John Watson's personal blog. And the screen is empty. And then it switches at the psychiatrist, his therapists's office. And they're talking and she suggests to him have you started your blog? He says yes, and she's like you haven't written anything yet. And he is like well you just wrote "still has trust issues". And she's says oh you're reading my writing upside down on my paper. And so he's sitting down and she's sitting across from him. She's writing everything on her notepad. And he has a cane. And that was also visible in the bedroom scene. Which is this, the bedroom was a small rectangular, pretty, um not a lot of life in it, very nondescript. And then the therapist's office looks like a regular therapist office. And his therapist is a black woman, and she's speaking to him about the blog and tells him, you know that would really help him. And then it switches to a man walking and he's on the phone with a woman. And she's in an office and she says oh where are you? And basically he doesn't want to get a cab, but she tells him to get a cab. And then she tells him that she loves him secretly, and he's said he'll actually get a cab. And then it switches to him in an empty, well you see his face taking this pill out of this glass bottle. And then it switches to a news conference where this woman who's not the woman who said she loved him, says my husband was a happy man who loved his work, his family, this suicide makes no sense. And can see apparently his mistress standing there looking sad. And it shows a scene of him on an office floor, like an apartment but with nothing in it, and he's dead on the floor. It then switches to two boys running in the rain in the dark. It's pouring rain, only one of them has an umbrella. Then like its raining so hard, I'm gonna go just grab an umbrella. and the guy's like why don't you share mine? He's like no its fine, its fine. And then it switches to him also taking the pill. And you see a newspaper heading that says, boy 18 kills himself outside sports stadium. And at that point it switches to a woman, oh and each scene it shows a date. So I think this woman is January 27, maybe. And its at a party and it shows a picture of a face, the head, the guest of honor. And then there's two people, a white woman and a black man sitting at a bar, and she's like oh she's still dancing, if you can call it that. And got your car keys? And the woman shows her car keys, like putting them in my bag. And at that point it switches to the woman in a back room and she takes the pill as well, the same pill that the other two have taken and she's sobbing. At that point it switches to a news conference. And the woman you later ?? is Sergeant Donovan, and then the man, the Private, Sergeant… Are at a news conference with lots of supporters and they're answering questions about the murders, or well no the suicides. And she says yes there's clearly a linkage between these now, there's been three deaths where the same poison that's been taken. And the court reporters, especially one woman, questions how can there be a link between suicides? Like basically skepticism, like suicides can't be linked. And the seemingly incompetent Sergeant answers, well there's the same poison, we've got our best people on it. And when he says there's a link, like there are suicides, like everyone in the room, all their phones go off. And the screen shows a bunch of, the screen shows the words and they all show wrong. So they've clearly all gotten a text message that says wrong. And then he starts to says something else, like we've got our best people working on it, and I think he says, he gets a text message that says wrong as well. And then this woman asks, well so how can we protect ourselves? And he kind of flippantly responds to her, saying don't commute suicide. And then Sergeant Donovan says ?? clearly implying that this is a woman that we should answer with sincerity. And so the man says oh well take all precautions, we're as safe as we thinks ourselves. And they all get a text that says wrong. And each of those the first texts, the woman had said if you've all received a text, please ignore it. She seems annoyed. And then the man gets a text that says, if you have any questions, you know where to find me, SH. And the pair walk out of the news room and the woman is frustrated, like we have to figure out how he does that, we have to make him stop. And the guy is like oh if I knew how he did it, I would stop it. It then switches to a morgue. And no it switches to Doctor Watson, I'm not quite sure of the order of these two scenes. Anyway you see Dr. Watson and he's walking in the park and his friend yells out John! And he turns around, turns out that its a, one of his friends, also older, middle aged man, slightly chubby, as he calls himself. And he says oh hey, clearly old friends, turns out they were old school friends. Basically and next thing they're drinking coffee on a bench. And they're talking and John's like, John's pretty reticent. And his friend's says oh how's it going, like what happened? Or like, he's like, beforehand like oh I heard you were off in the war getting shot, like what happened? John's like, i got shot. And, well I guess Watson's what he's usually called. So Watson is talking to him, and he's like oh you're just getting yourself situated, and Watson's like oh you can't live in London off an army pension, but you don't want to live anywhere else. But why don't you ask Harriet for help? And Watson says I'm not going to ask Harriet, I can't ask Harriet for help. And then they're talking and oh and then John, his friend's like oh you should maybe get a flat mate, a flat share or something. And then Watson says oh who would want me for a flat mate? His friend chuckles and and John Watson's like whats up? And this friend's like your the second person who's told me that today. And then it switches to the morgue. So either that scene happened before this or after. But basically there's a body of this woman and like we see these shots from the perspective of the corpse. Look at it, and she's like oh what happened? And like the lab tech-assistant, oh I just got in, like 62 possible causes of death or something. Next thing you know, Sherlock's getting at it, hitting the corpse with a riding whip and the woman comes back, Sherlock asks, oh you have lipstick on? And she's clearly trying to ask him out, and he hardcore rejects her. And she asks if he wants to get coffee later, and he's like oh yes, black one sugar. And so he tells her please note down what bruises come down in 20 minutes, its imperative to his alibi. And I forgot to mention that there's the opening sequence which is scenes of London that says Sherlock, happens after the first scene with Watson. Anyways, back to where I was, at this point Sherlock is in the lab, and Watson and the friend walk in. And Watson's limping, and Sherlock asks if he can borrow the phone of the friend, but the friend doesn't have his phone, and Sherlock's phone doesn't have signal. So Watson offers his, and Sherlock sends a text quickly, and then he's like, they have a conversation where Sherlock asks about the flat mate stuff, and Watson is surprised that Watson already knows about the flat mate, that he's asking for a flat mate. And Sherlock says well, I mentioned to my friend that I'm looking for a flatmate and then he comes and shows up later that day with a multiple friend who he just met for lunch, over lunch, what else would it be? And then Sherlock does his analysis of Watson, says oh Afghanistan or Iraq? And Watson is surprised and says Afghanistan. And he's like oh military doctor. So basically Sherlock shows off his skills while the friend looks bemused. And Sherlock says oh yes you have, let me get into this analysis, or no he's like oh well lets meet tomorrow, 221B Baker Street, at 7pm. at 7. And Watson's like hold up, we don't know each other, how do you know we could be flatmates? And Sherlock's like well, you're a military doctor who just returned from Afghanistan, clearly looking for a flat mate, you have brother who you don't get along with, maybe because of the fact he's an alcoholic, maybe because he just left his wife, um this therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic, and your.. I think he says something else about his brother. And so he continues and Watson is really impressed. And then Sherlock leaves ????? and the friend's like he's always like that. And then um it shows a picture of a woman with pink nails. She's wearing pink and she's in the room and she takes the same pills. And then it switches to Watson in um, Watson arriving at 221B Baker Street, and Sherlock pulls up in a black car just as Watson arrives, and they walk up and he's like oh I was about to enter, and Watson's like this is a nice area, must be pretty expensive. Sherlock's like no I know the landlady and she owes me a favor. Her husband was about to get sentenced to death and I helped her out. And Watson's like oh you got him, you ensure that he wasn't executed? And Sherlock's like no I ensured it. And Watson was.. Sherlock was like no I ensured it. So he walks in, and Watson walks in behind him, and they walk up the stairs, into a room. Its very cluttered, as ??? but there's boxes and papers everywhere, there's a living room, and they turn left and there's a kitchen area. And Watson's like oh very nice very nice. And then starts talking, and Sherlock starts talking at the same time, Watson's like oh we'll clear it out, clean it up, and Sherlock basically tells him that this is where he's already living and the mess is all his. And so Watson's kind of surprised. And then Watson sits down, and Sherlock is talking.. And then Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson is there, oh yes you know, nice place, and Sherlock looks out the window, and there..are they talking about the murders? Or like there's a picture. And then ?? murders. And then Sherlock looks out the window and goes like four. And sees the police car. And its different this time. And just then you see the Sergeant walking up the stairs. And then Sherlock's like, where? And the Sergeant tells him where it is, and Sherlock's like whats different this time? And he says they left a note. And so at that point,                                    Sherlock is like alright, he's like are you coming? He's like oh not in a police car, I'll be right there. And then Sherlock gets really excited, he goes yessss and he pumps his fists, and then like four suicides, serial suicides, and a note, doesn't get better than this! And he gets all excited, he tells Mrs. Hudson I may need something to eat when I get back, like I'll be back late. She's like I'm your landlady, not your housekeeper! And he's like oh something cold will do, and he's full of excitement and leaves. And then she's like oh look at him all excited. And then she says oh you're more of the sitting down type aren't you, she says to Watson. Watson's like kind of perplexed by that. She's like let me get you a cup of, but just this once I'm not your land--only this once. Oh yes I'd love a cup of tea, he gets angry when she mentions his leg. And then she's like ???. And then Sherlock comes back in the room and is like you're a military doctor, any good? And Watson's like yeah, really good. And then um Sherlock says do you wanna come along? Oh I forgot that during the conversation the Sergeant's like who's on forensics? And the Sergeant says a name. And oh he won't work with me, but I need an assistant. And so that becomes relevant in the scene between SH and when Sherlock says oh I need an assistant, you're a military doctor, let's go. And so Watson follows him, and says oh I don't need that camomile tea after all. And so they, and Watson follows Sherlock, and they both sort of, they go and they, Sherlock hails a cab. And in the cab ride, they discuss the analysis Sherlock made of Watson. And throughout this it shows what inspired, it basically flash backs to the specific details that Sherlock noticed, for example a close up of the phone, a close up of Watson's hands. And Watson's like how did you know all those things? And Sherlock explains all well you have a nice phone but you're broke, so clearly it was a gift, you're a military hero who's struggling with money and clearly don't have much family, probably like your brother, this inscription that says from Clara, but this phone is only 6 months old, so if he had been left by her, then he would have kept it, but if he left her then he wants to get rid of it. So oh then he's like it has lots of scratches so its been in a pocket, but that's not you-- well before this whole phone situation, he tells how he could tell he was a military doctor, so his posture, his posture says military, the way he entered the room says military doctor, Afghanistan because he had a tan, but then he was limping, so clearly not just somewhere to be tan, not somewhere for leisure. He has a psychosomatic limp because he did not sit down, which means that its at least partially psychosomatic, and he has a therapist because he like has a psychosomatic limp, ?? with his therapist. And then… He answers his whole analysis, like the scratches on the screen which meant that he put keys in pockets, and also he could tell like the alcohol, which Watson is like how did you just know about the alcohol? And well its all scuffed up around the phone charger, so he's like oh when you're charging it every night, the phone was never steady. And I never see a sober person's phone with it, never see an alcoholic's phone without it. So he's like, Watson's like wow that's amazing. And Sherlock's like that's not people's normal reaction. Watson't like what is? Like piss off, Sherlock says. And so at this point, they're driving in car, its getting kind of dark and they arrive at the crime scene, and Donovan is there, and she is not happy to see Sherlock. She's is like the freak is here, what are you doing here? And he's like you know I was invited. Why? By the Sergeant. And they walk in, and then she hold it lifts it up and then Watson comes in and she's like oh who's this? And like oh he's with me, he's my assistant. Great come along, and meet Dr. Watson, and Sherlock tells her oh like you didn't go home last night. And then she seems really, and then then he walks up to the forensics man who had been mentioned recently. And oh so this is all taking place on this street outside this old house, there're police cars everywhere and there's people like going around. We see this guy in a blue jumpsuit, Sherlock like I don't, this is a crime scene I don't want it contaminated. He's like oh fine, he's like ohh nice deodorant, its very its quite like, or no he's like how long is your wife in town? No Sherlock says to the forensics specialist, how long is your wife out of town? And Anderson is like no you didn't just figure that out, someone told you. And Sherlock says no one told me, you're wearing deodorant, and the guy's like of course I'm wearing deodorant, its men's deodorant. And Sherlock's like yeah you're wearing it, and so is Donovan. So he calls them out. And then he says oh yes and judging by the state of her knees, she was scrubbing your floors. And he's like oh I'm sure she just came over for a cup of tea and spent the night. The forensics specialist is kept speechless and Sherlock walks in with Watson. Walk into the house, and this is when the break happens, but so they walk, and they go back, but they walk into this, its very old, derelict, um its pretty dilapidated. No painting on the walls, wooden, well the paint is peeling, old style, no furniture, very bare, we see other specialists walking around. And they meet the Sergeant, they go into a room, oh put these on, so Watson starts putting on the jumpsuit, and he's like oh why aren't you doing it? Sherlock doesn't answer, clearly above it. And then Sherlock, the man's like oh I can give you two minutes, like oh I may need more than that. He's like where is she? They walk up the stairs, she's in this room, he walks up very slowly, and its this woman dressed in a pink skirt and suit jacket. Pink nail polish, she's has RACHE written, with her, scraped in the floor with her nails. Blonde lady, her pink shoes splayed out on the floor with both her hands, her arms to the side of her head, face down, and there's nothing else in the room. Sherlock walks in, they all walk in, and Watson kind of walks in slowly, absorbs it, and on the way up the Sergeant says oh ??. And so then Sherlock says shut up to the detective and then he's like what? Sherlock's like you're thinking, its annoying. And so then Sherlock just looks, slowly approaches it, and then so you kind of get a window into his head, so you see RACHE in like, written in down, German for revenge, or RACHEL. So you, and then you see the nails on her left hand so she's left handed. He scrapes the back of her coat, sees that its wet, sees that the inside of her collar is wet, he pulls out an umbrella from her pocket, its dry. He then does a scan of her jewelry, necklace is clean, earring is clean, gold, blah blah, wedding ring, dirty. Unhappily married at least 10 years. Takes the wedding ring off her finger, clean on the inside, removed frequently. And he finishes her examination of her, he stands up and the Sergeants like okay what have you got? Late 30s, Sherlock checks his phone for weather stuff, she just came back from a specific town that I can't quite remember the name of. Watson is, the guy leaves and Watson is allowed, Sherlock tells Watson to take a look, and the guy's like wait a second, I'm already giving you leeway, ?????. The Sergeant's like gosh dammit I do. So he just walks in says you go ahead, so Watson sits next to him, kneels down, kind of trouble with his knee, he like holds the woman's hand, feels her like the veins, looks at her, and like the Sergeant comes back is like well? And Watson's like clearly asphyxiated, maybe choked on her own vomit. And Sherlock is like its the same poison as before, its the poison from the serial suicides. And then there's a conversation about the facts that Sherlock has discovered. Okay late 30s, serial adulterer, had a lot of lovers, unhappily married for the last 10 years, you can see that her wedding ring is dirty, all her other jewelry is clean, but the inside is more clean than the outside which means that only polishing??? regularly. She needed to have a bunch of string of lovers because its hard to pretend to be single for a long time, a number of boyfriends, knew that she was married. She probably worked, she was a businesswoman judging by the attire, media probably judging by the suit color. She was in the rain because her jacket was wet, it was also really windy, because well so this is the response, her outfit is a response to the Sergeant's surprise when the guy says she was from this specific town and she only wanted to stay overnight. He's like how do you know this? Well the coat is wet, the front the umbrella is dry and the collar is wet so that means it was windy but too strong wind for an umbrella. And she's well dressed but she only had a small case, it must have been an overnight case, so she must not have traveled more than two to three hours, and also he knows that because her coat has not had time to dry. And he says where has there been rain like that in London, within a two hour radius? This town.. something. And he knows that she had a case because there are mud splatters on her thigh or her left leg or right leg, so the small case must have left the splatter. He can tell that it was, the forensic scientist at some point shows up and Sherlock just shuts him down ??? Rachel is or whatever. Or is like where's the case, where's the case? And the guys, the Sergeant's like there never was a case. And Sherlock says what? And Watson's amazed by this the whole time and he Sherlock gets so excited and he runs down the stairs like oh yes its a murder! Like a serial killer. Oh this is so exciting. We just have to wait for him to make a mistake. There's no case, that was the murderer must have taken the case. He's like oh where would it be, maybe she left it in her hotel? And Sherlock's like look at her hair, she coordinates her lipstick and her shoes, she would not leave her hotel with her hair looking like that. Where's the case Where's the case? It all ?? in themselves that it was murder. He's running, he's like what's her name? Find me like all the names of the family, find me Rachel in her hometown. I'm going to go look for, has anyone seen the case? He says he's going to go look for the case. And so then Watson goes downstairs to the house and Donovan, Sherlock has left, and Donovan's like oh he left, he does that. SHe's like you should stay away from him, he gets off from this. He doesn't get paid, He's just a weird character you should stay away from him. And he's like alright and she kind of listens and he's like can you help me find a cab, my leg. And she's like down by the main road, and she's like yeah he's a psychopath stay away form him. And he's like alright. At that point, Watson is walking down the road and a public telephone rings and he doesn't pick up, and then walking by a chicken place and that phone rings and he down't pick up. Finally he's walking by another telephone and that rings as he's passing it, so he picks up is like Hello? And this strange voice says look to your security camera on your right. And like the security camera turns around. And like look to the security camera on you left, and security camera turns around. And look at the security camera on the roof and he's like now you know your situation I don't have to threat, step into the car now. And he's like who is this, it doesn't matter. So Watson gets into the car, there's this attractive young brunette in the back seat who's always on her phone. Um and he's like is there any point in asking where I'm going? SHe's like no. Um is ?? right? Then he asks her a couple other questions…. Yeah so then he they arrive in this abandoned parking garage. Watson is like there's a seat and a man, an older man around 40s, 50s, holding a long umbrella and he's standing there. And Watsons like ?? have a seat and Watson's like I don't want to sit down. So the guys like ?? bothering you. And then the guy says, they have a long conversation, and what you find is that the guy is an enemy of Sherlock and he wants to bribe Watson into getting information. And he's like so how do you know Sherlock and Watson's like I just don't I met him yesterday. And he's like oh really, you met him yesterday, you're moving in today, and now you're solving crimes, should I expect an announcement any time soon? And he's like its not like that, or he just Watson's pretty defiant and returned all his responses. And the guy says I'm sure you've been warned to stay away from Sherlock… And then um the guy says oh you has trust issues… keep thinking??? the ones that Sherlock needs based on his description. So he's like oh yes, a military doctor, that kind of thing. And he has the book that the therapist had, so he has Watson's therapist's book which is disturbing I'm sure for him. Oh yes, trust issues, then why do you trust Sherlock? And then ????? Sherlock doesn't have any friends, i'm the closest he has to a friend, an enemy. Or he would probably say arch enemy. He has a tendency to be dramatic. Watson sarcastically says, well its a good thing you're not like that. And then at that point… Yeah so at that point Watson refuses the the bribe, so like what would you say if I was to offer you some money for your participation. And Watson says I'm not interested. Oh you're loyal, and Watson's like I'm just not interested. He's like well I'm sure where you're living now, 221 Baker street.. mentions something about the address. And he's like oh you should fire your therapist, she has it all wrong. And she said that you have, give me your left hand. Watson refuses it at first and then he does it. Like oh yes she said that you have a tremor from your right and which is PTSD from the war, but she's like you she thinks you're haunted by the war, but like she's got it backwards, you're not haunted by the war, you miss it. So like its time to choose sides, and he walks away. And throughout this conversation Watson has been receiving text messages from Sherlock saying if convenient, please come to Baker Street. Next to message, if inconvenient still come. And the final message says may be dangerous. So Watson is driven by the woman, driven by the car with the woman back to Baker Street, and he's like any chance you could not tell your boss where I went? And she's like sure…. and he's like you already told him didn't you? And she's like yeah. And he's like do you have any free time any time? And she's like oh yeah lots of it. And then he asks her, would you want to get coffee some time? And she's like bye! So, pretty superficial character. Then he walks in and Sherlock is lying on the couch in a trance, has three nicotine patches on his arm, like oh yeah nicotine, can't keep up a smoking habit in London these days, nicotine helps me think, and Watson's like is that three patches on your arm? And Sherlock's like yes. And its a three patches kind of a case. So then Sherlock's like, can you send this text message or, can I have your phone. And Watson's like, you got me all the way from the other side of London, to use my phone? Watson's like yes, well mine, I can't use mine because it might get recognized its on the website, and I can't use.. and Watson says well Mrs. Hudson has a phone, and Sherlock is like yes she's downstairs, I tried shouting but it didn't work. I was on the other side of London, but Sherlock's like, you came. So he gives him his phone, and Sherlock sends a text, I think like going out. Go to my desk and there's a number, and please send a text to this number, and Watson every time he obeys an order kind of has to kind of swallow his pride I guess and does.. You got me all the way here to send a text. So he sends it word for word, and the text is, What happened at Lauridsen Garden? I must have blacked out. Please come quickly and then he gives an address. And then Sherlock says he figured it out, like the case, the pink case. The murderer took the case, that was his first mistake. Must have taken it by accident. So exciting, kind of discuss the case, like the he says it must be the murderer, and then they. Watson sits down and Sherlock stands up, and they're talking and Watson realizes he just sent a text to the murderer and Sherlock pulls out the pink case and says he found it, or basically that he searched, the murderer must have accidentally taken the case in the back of his trunk, and then he had to get rid of it because its a pink case. Watson's like you knew all this because it was pink? And so it would be really conspicuous cuz like anyone with this case, especially if its a random, its much more likely to be obvious. And so Sherlock says he looked all around in a 5 minute radius for places you could drop of the kind of case he found. And you see pictures of him finding it. So he finds it in a dumpster and he opens it. And then there's no phone anywhere. Where is the phone? It wasn't on the body, it isn't in the suitcase, he must have it. Watson then maybe she left it? Sherlock's like no, she's a serial adulterer she would be careful with this. So then the murderer, or like the phone rings, and Sherlock's like its the murderer, he's calling. Like if it was anyone else, they would have just ignored it. But a murderer who just got rid of his final victim and thinks he killed her? Now he gets a call from her, he would be freaking out. And so then Watson stands up, well Sherlock stands up and is getting ready to leave to go there. He's like are you coming? Watson's like come with you? He's like yeah or you can just watch telly. He's like this is.. aren't you going to tell the police? He like oh there's no time to tell the police. THen Watson's like you have time to talk to me. He's like well Mrs. Hudson took my skull. Um when he had a skull earlier. And he's like no I think better out loud, I like having company, and the skull attracts attention, kind of smiles. And so previously the man who Watson had talked to in the garage kind of insinuated that Watson misses the war, and he's like welcome back, like he misses the excitement. And Watson had actually gone to his apartment and picked up his gun on the way to Sherlock's apartment. And now Watson kind of is like, well you came, sent me all the way over here, oh and Watson had told Sherlock about the bribery attempt. And Sherlock said, Watson who was that? Sherlock says the most dangerous man you've ever met, but he's not my concern right now. And Sherlock is like come on lets go, he's like well you sent me a text that said ? Well I also said it was dangerous, so lets go. So Watson sighs and decides to go. And I forgot to mention one scene where Watson looks up Sherlock on the internet, and this happens way back after their first meeting, and before the meeting in the house, and Sherlock says, Watson tells them about that. Sherlock describes it. And Sherlock also in the car, on the way to the crime scene, like they're talking about and like Watson is like what are you? You're not a private detective, the police department doesn't hire private detectives. And Sherlock is like no, I'm a consultant detective, not an amateur. And so those are just two scenes that I forgot to mention that kind of describe more the character of Sherlock. And so the part that I watched ends with Sherlock and Watson leaving the building and walking out of the house.
