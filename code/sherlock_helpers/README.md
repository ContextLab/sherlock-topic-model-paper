# `sherlock_helpers`

This is a miniature Python package meant to accompany the analysis notebooks in 
[ContextLab/sherlock-topic-model-paper](https://github.com/ContextLab/sherlock-topic-model-paper).
It contains functions and constants that are re-used across multiple analyses 
(to ensure consistency), along with a few convenience functions/notebook 
hacks for displaying code and data.

If you want to replicate any of the analyses or figures from the paper (or just 
play around with the notebooks), simply build the Docker environment following the 
instructions in the 
[main README](https://github.com/ContextLab/sherlock-topic-model-paper/blob/master/README.md), 
and the `sherlock_helpers` package will be installed automatically in the container.
