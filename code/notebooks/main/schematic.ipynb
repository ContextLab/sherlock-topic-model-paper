There has to be one.\" Everyone's phones trill a text message alert at the same time. The reporters all check their phones.

Okay, if there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade…\"  Donovan continues: \"…I'm going to bring this session to an end.\" Lestrade remains silent and seated beside her.  Reporter 2 asks: \" But if they're suicides, what are you investigating?\" Lestrade answers with his hands together: \"As I say, these…these suicides are clearly linked. Um, it's an…it's an unusual situation. We've got our best people investigating…\" Everyone's phones trill another text alert again. Everybody looks down at their phones, including the reporters and Lestrade.  Once again, each message reads: Wrong! Close up view of Lestrade's phone. Reporter 1 says in the background: \"Says, 'Wrong,' again.\" Lestrade looks despairingly toward Donovan to his left.  Donovan states: \"One more question.\" Reporter 3 asks \"Is there any chance that these are murders, and if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?\"  Lestrade replies: \"I…I know that you like wriitng about these, but these do appear to be suicides.

      "Sherlock closely inspects the delivate gold bracelet on her left wrist: clean Sherlock leans a little closer to see her gold earring attached to her left ear: clean Sherlock also takes a look at the gold chain around her neck: clean Sherlock puts his magnifying glass closer toward the victim's left hand to look at her rings.  A view of the wedding ring and engagement ring flag a different message to Sherlock: dirty Sherlock blinks as a rapid succession of conclusions appear in front of his eyes Back to a view of the rings. The conclusions Sherlock draw are: married, unhappily married, unhappily married 10+ years John is keenly watching. He tilts his head left and right, wondering what Sherlock is doing.  Carefully Sherlock works the wedding ring off the woman's finger and holds it up to look at the inside of the ring.  While the outside of the ring is still showing dirty, the inside registers as, clean As Sherlock lowers the ring and slides it back onto the woman's finger, he has already reached a conclusion about the ring: regularly removed Lifting his hands away from the woman, he looks down at her and makes his final deduction about her.  A view of the woman's face on the floor. Sherlock's deduction serial adulterer appears next to her.  Sherlock smiles slightly in satisfaction.  Lestrade breaks the silence and asks: \"Got anything?\" Sherlock removes his gloves and stands up and nonchalantly replies: \"Not much.\"  Sherlock reaches into his coat pocket and gets his mobile phone. Someone's voice is heard saying: \"She's German.\" Anderson, from where he is casually leaning against the doorway continues: \"'Rache': It's German for 'revenge'. She could be trying to tell us something…\" While he is speaking, Sherlock has walked quickly towards the door and now begins to close it in Anderson's face. Sherlock is looking at something on his phone while walking.  Sherlock, while not taking his eyes of his phone, says sarcastically: \"Yes, thank you for your input\" then slams the door shut. He turns and walks back into the room.  John looks contemplative. In the background Lestrade asks: \"So she's german?\" Sherlock while speaking has called up a menu for UK weather on his phone. The menu offers five options: Maps, Local, Warnings, Next 24 Hours, 7 Day Forecast. He selects the Maps option. Sherlock, still looking at his phone, says: \"Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night....\" Sherlock smiles smugly when he apparently finds the information he needed from his phone. He continues: \"...before returning to Cardiff\" He then pockets his phone.  John is looking a little confused, lost in his thoughts, when Sherlock says: \"So far, so obvious.\"  John incredulously asks: \"Sorry - obvious?\" Lestrade asks: \"What about the message, though?\" Sherlock ignores Lestrade, looks at John and asks: \"Doctor Watson, what do you think?\" John looks round at Lestrade, then at Sherlock and asks: \"Of the message?\" Sherlock: \"Of the body. You're a medical man.\" Lestrade interjects: \"Wait, no, we have a whole team right outside.\" Sherlock replies: \"They won't work with me.\" Cut to John awkwardly staying silent during the conversation between Sherlock and Lestrade Lestrade says: \"I'm breaking every rule letting you in here.\" Sherlock states confidently: \"Yes…because you need me.\"  John quickly turns round to Lestrade to see his reaction Lestrade stares at him for a moment with his mouth ready to defend himself, then he lowers his eyes helplessly and says: \"Yes, I do. God help me.\" Sherlock says: \"Doctor Watson.\" John looks up from the body to Sherlock and says: \"Hm?\" Then he turns his head towards Lestrade, silently seeking his permission.  Lestrade, a little tetchily, says: \"Oh, do as he says. Help yourself\" He turns and opens the door, going outside. \n"

John opens his desk drawer.  John takes out his pistol from the drawer. John checks the clip of the gun.  John tucks the gun into the back of his waistband of his jeans and turns to leave again.  Later, the car pulls up outside of 221B Baker Street.  Inside the car, Anthea is still fixated on her phone. John looks across the her and says: \"Listen, your boss - any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?\" Anthea nonchalantly says: \"Sure.\" John: \"You've told him already, haven't you?\" Anthea smiles across to him briefly then says: \"Yeah.\" John nods in resignation.  John turns to get out of the car, but just as he opens the door, he turns back to her and asks: \"Hey, um… do you ever get any free time?\" Anthea smiles while typing on her phone, and sarcastically says: \"Oh yeah, lots.\" John smiles and looks at her, waiting expectantly. She continues working on her phone for a long moment.  Anthea turns and looks at him before allowing her gaze to drift past him to the door of 221B. She says: \"Bye.\" Indicating that John should leave.  John says: \"Okay\" then he gets out of the car.  John gets out of the car onto the street.   The car drives away and John walks across the pavement to the front door of 221 B.  John knocks on the door. \n"
